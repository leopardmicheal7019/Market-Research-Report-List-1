<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-static Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Current</li><li>Alternating Current</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-static device market is categorized into two primary types based on the type of current used: Direct Current (DC) and Alternating Current (AC). DC anti-static devices use a constant electrical flow to neutralize static charges, making them effective for sensitive electronic environments, such as semiconductor manufacturing. In contrast, AC devices utilize an alternating flow, often providing broader applications in industrial settings where static control is required. Both types are essential for preventing damage to electronic components and ensuring worker safety.</p></p>
