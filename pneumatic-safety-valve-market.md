<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Safety Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface Safety Valves</li><li>Subsurface Safety Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pneumatic safety valve market includes two primary types: surface safety valves and subsurface safety valves. Surface safety valves are installed above ground, primarily in oil and gas applications, to quickly relieve pressure and prevent blowouts during unexpected surges. In contrast, subsurface safety valves are positioned underground or underwater, providing a critical safety measure to control wellbore pressures and prevent fluid release in case of an emergency. Both types are essential for enhancing operational safety and environmental protection in extraction processes.</p></p>
