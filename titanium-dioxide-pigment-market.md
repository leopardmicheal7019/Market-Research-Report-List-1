<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Titanium Dioxide Pigment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulfate Process</li><li>Chloride Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The titanium dioxide pigment market is primarily divided into two production processes: the sulfate process and the chloride process. The sulfate process involves the reaction of titanium ore with sulfuric acid, producing a lower-quality pigment with a higher impurity rate. In contrast, the chloride process uses titanium tetrachloride and is known for creating a purer, higher-quality pigment with better opacity and brightness. Both processes cater to different industrial applications, influencing pricing and market dynamics based on quality and production costs.</p></p>
